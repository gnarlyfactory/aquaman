PowerScheduler

    device      The device.
    state       The current state.
    next        The next state.
    _timer      The pending timer event.

    start()     Start the scheduler. Schedule the first state change,
                which should happen immediately.
    stop()      Stop the pending timer event.
    _changed()  Callback when a state change event occurs. This should
                schedule the next state change.
    _next()     Get the next state using the schedule. If the current
                state is null, it means we need the state which should
                be in force currently given the current time of day.
